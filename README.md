### Project Overview
---------------------
The goal of this project is to provide a foundational example of how to analyze and predict solar energy production. It covers:

Synthetic Data Generation 🧪: Creation of a realistic dataset simulating various factors influencing solar energy output.

Data Exploration 🗺️: Visualizing distributions and relationships within the data to understand key drivers of energy production.

Machine Learning Preparation 🤖: Setting up a framework for building and evaluating predictive models.

### Dataset
------------
The synthetic dataset generated in the notebook includes the following features:

Developer 🏢: The company that developed the solar plant.

Region 🌎: The geographical region where the solar plant is located.

Equipment_Type ⚙️: The type of solar panel technology used (e.g., Monocrystalline, Polycrystalline, Thin-Film).

System_Size_MW 📏: The megawatt capacity of the solar plant.

Solar_Irradiance_kWh_m2_year 🌞: The intensity of sunlight in the region (kWh/m² per year).

Panel_Efficiency_pct 💪: The efficiency percentage of the solar panels.

Shading_Factor 🌳: A factor representing the impact of shading (1.0 indicates no shade).

Average_Temperature_C 🌡️: The average annual temperature in Celsius.

Annual_Energy_Production_GWh ⚡: The annual energy produced by the plant in Gigawatt-hours (the target variable).

A sample of the dataset's first 5 rows and its information (data types, non-null counts) are printed in the notebook.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍
--------------------------------------
The notebook performs comprehensive EDA to understand the dataset's characteristics and relationships between variables. This includes:

Distribution of Annual Energy Production 📊: A histogram with a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plot to show the distribution of the target variable.

Relationships with Numerical Features 📈: Scatter plots illustrating the correlation between System_Size_MW, Solar_Irradiance_kWh_m2_year, Panel_Efficiency_pct, and Annual_Energy_Production_GWh.

Relationships with Categorical Features 📦: Box plots to visualize how Developer, Region, and Equipment_Type affect Annual_Energy_Production_GWh.

Correlation Matrix heatmap ร้อน 🌡️: A heatmap displaying the correlation coefficients between all numerical features.

### Machine Learning Pipeline (Setup) 🤖
-----------------------------------------
The notebook imports several libraries from scikit-learn to prepare for machine learning tasks. While a full model training and evaluation is not explicitly shown in the provided content, the imports suggest the intention to implement:

Data Splitting ✂️: train_test_split for dividing data into training and testing sets.

Preprocessing 🧹: StandardScaler for numerical feature scaling and OneHotEncoder for handling categorical features.

Column Transformation 🔄: ColumnTransformer to apply different transformations to different columns.

Pipelines 🔗: Pipeline to streamline preprocessing and model training.

Models 🧠: LinearRegression, Ridge, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor for regression tasks.

Evaluation Metrics ✅: mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score for model performance assessment.
